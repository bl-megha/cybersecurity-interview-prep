## Setting Up the Battle: Three-Way Tool Comparison

After spending 3+ years with Qualys VMDR, I'm expanding my toolkit. Here's my hands-on comparison of the "Big Three" vulnerability scanners.

## Test Environment Setup

**Target Network:**
- 50 mixed assets (Windows, Linux, web applications)
- VulnHub VMs for consistent testing
- Same credentials across all tools

**Scan Configuration:**
- Authenticated scans with admin credentials
- Full port range scanning
- Standard vulnerability policies

## Performance Comparison

| Scan Time | 45 minutes | 38 minutes | 42 minutes |
| Vulnerabilities Found | 1,247 | 1,389 | 1,298 |
| False Positives | 12% | 8% | 15% |
| Report Generation | 3 minutes | 5 minutes | 2 minutes |
