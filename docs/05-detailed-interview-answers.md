## 🎯 Technical Questions with Detailed Answers

### Q: "Walk me through your vulnerability management process from scan to remediation."

**Detailed Answer:**

"My vulnerability management process follows a comprehensive 6-step methodology that I've refined over 3+ years managing enterprise environments:

**1. Asset Discovery & Inventory (Foundation)**
- Maintain accurate CMDB with asset criticality ratings (Tier 1: Customer-facing, Tier 2: Internal business, Tier 3: Development)
- Currently manage 3,000+ assets across BFSI environments with 99.2% asset discovery accuracy
- Integrate with ServiceNow for automated asset lifecycle management

**2. Scan Configuration & Scheduling (Optimization)**
- Configure authenticated scans using Qualys VMDR with custom policies for Windows, Linux, and web applications
- Schedule critical systems weekly, standard infrastructure monthly, development environments quarterly
- Optimize scan windows to minimize business impact (maintenance windows, low-traffic periods)

**3. Risk-Based Prioritization (Intelligence)**
- Use matrix combining CVSS base score (40%), exploitability via EPSS (25%), business criticality (25%), and exposure level (10%)
- Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS 9-10) on internet-facing systems receive immediate attention
- Integrate threat intelligence from multiple sources for context-aware prioritization

**4. Remediation Workflow (Execution)**
- Generate ServiceNow tickets with specific remediation steps, patches, and business justification
- Collaborate directly with system administrators providing technical guidance and timeline expectations
- Maintain clear escalation paths for delayed remediations affecting SLA compliance

**5. Verification & Closure (Quality Assurance)**
- Conduct targeted rescans within 48 hours of reported remediation
- Validate fixes through both automated scanning and manual verification when necessary
- Currently maintain 95% closure rate for critical vulnerabilities within 30-day SLA

**6. Metrics & Continuous Improvement (Optimization)**
- Generate executive dashboards showing MTTR trends, vulnerability aging, and risk reduction metrics
- My reporting improvements helped reduce average MTTR from 45 to 28 days organization-wide
- Conduct monthly process reviews to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

This systematic approach has enabled us to maintain consistently high security posture while minimizing business disruption."

### Q: "How do you prioritize vulnerabilities when you have limited resources?"

**Detailed Answer:**

"Resource constraints are a reality in every environment, so I use a four-factor prioritization matrix that maximizes risk reduction with available resources:

**Factor 1: CVSS + Exploitability (40% weight)**
- CVSS 9-10: Immediate action required within 24-48 hours
- Active exploits in the wild receive automatic priority boost regardless of base score
- Leverage EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) for likelihood assessment
- Example: CVSS 7.5 with active exploitation gets higher priority than CVSS 8.8 without exploitation

**Factor 2: Asset Criticality (30% weight)**
- Tier 1: Revenue-generating systems, customer data repositories, payment processing
- Tier 2: Internal business systems, HR applications, email infrastructure
- Tier 3: Development environments, test systems, administrative tools
- Document asset ownership and business impact for each system

**Factor 3: Exposure Level (20% weight)**
- Internet-facing assets: Highest priority due to external threat exposure
- DMZ systems: Medium priority with controlled access points
- Internal-only systems: Lower priority but still tracked and managed
- Consider network segmentation and access controls in assessment

**Factor 4: Remediation Complexity (10% weight)**
- Simple patches requiring minimal downtime: Quick wins for immediate risk reduction
- Complex changes requiring testing and coordination: Planned for maintenance windows
- Workarounds and compensating controls: Temporary risk mitigation while planning permanent fixes

**Real-World Example:**
A CVSS 8.5 SQL injection vulnerability on our internet-facing payment processing system gets higher priority than a CVSS 9.2 privilege escalation vulnerability on an internal test server. The payment system vulnerability threatens customer data and business operations, while the test server has limited business impact and restricted access.

**Results Using This Approach:**
- Reduced critical vulnerability count by 78% in 6 months
- Improved stakeholder satisfaction through transparent prioritization
- Achieved 100% SLA compliance for business-critical systems
- Optimized resource allocation reducing remediation costs by 35%

This framework ensures we address the highest business risk first while maintaining transparent, defensible prioritization decisions."
