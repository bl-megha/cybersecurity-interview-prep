## üéØ Technical Interview Questions

### Vulnerability Scanning & Assessment

**Q: "Walk me through your vulnerability management process from scan to remediation."**

*Key points to cover:*
- Asset discovery and inventory management
- Scan scheduling and configuration strategies
- Risk-based prioritization using CVSS + business context
- Remediation workflow and tracking mechanisms
- Verification and closure processes
- Metrics, reporting, and continuous improvement

**Q: "How do you prioritize vulnerabilities when you have limited resources?"**

*Framework to discuss:*
- CVSS base score + exploitability + business criticality matrix
- Asset criticality and exposure level assessment
- Available patches and remediation complexity
- Business impact and maintenance window considerations
- Threat intelligence and active exploitation indicators

**Q: "Explain the difference between CVSS 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1."**

*Comparison points:*
- CVSS 2.0: Basic scoring with fundamental metrics
- CVSS 3.0: Added scope changes and attack complexity refinements
- CVSS 3.1: Environmental score improvements and metric clarifications
- Practical implications for vulnerability prioritization

**Q: "Compare Qualys vs Nessus vs Rapid7 - when would you use each?"**

*Decision framework:*
- **Qualys**: Cloud-native, strong compliance, enterprise scalability
- **Nessus**: Deep scanning capabilities, extensive plugin library
- **Rapid7**: Strong integration, incident response focus, automation
- Use case scenarios and recommendation criteria

### Risk Assessment & Management

**Q: "How would you handle a critical vulnerability discovered in production?"**

*Response structure:*
1. Immediate assessment (CVSS score, exploitability, business impact)
2. Stakeholder notification (security team, business owners, executives)
3. Threat intelligence verification (active exploitation, available exploits)
4. Mitigation options analysis (patch, workaround, compensating controls)
5. Implementation planning with timeline and rollback procedures
6. Verification, monitoring, and lessons learned

**Q: "How do you reduce false positives in vulnerability scans?"**

*Techniques to discuss:*
- Asset discovery accuracy and CMDB integration
- Scan policy tuning and authenticated scanning optimization
- Plugin selection and customization strategies
- Business context integration and asset criticality
- Regular scan validation and feedback loop implementation

### Tool-Specific Questions

**Q: "What are the key differences between authenticated and unauthenticated scans?"**

*Comparison framework:*
- **Unauthenticated**: Network-level vulnerabilities, service enumeration, external perspective
- **Authenticated**: OS-level checks, installed software analysis, configuration assessment
- **Hybrid approach**: Balancing comprehensive coverage with credential management

**Q: "How do you optimize scan performance for large networks?"**

*Optimization strategies:*
- Scan scheduling and network segmentation
- Concurrent scan limits and bandwidth management
- Scan policy optimization and plugin selection
- Asset grouping and targeted scanning approaches
- Infrastructure placement and distributed scanning architecture

## üé≠ Behavioral Interview Questions (STAR Method)

### Leadership & Influence

**Q: "Tell me about a time you had to convince stakeholders to prioritize a security patch."**

*STAR framework preparation:*
- **Situation**: Set up the business context and resistance
- **Task**: Define your responsibility and objectives
- **Action**: Detail your approach, communication strategy, and tactics
- **Result**: Quantify the outcome and business impact

**Q: "Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult team to implement remediation."**

*Focus areas:*
- Communication and relationship building techniques
- Understanding different perspectives and constraints
- Finding collaborative solutions and compromises
- Maintaining professional relationships under pressure

### Problem-Solving & Innovation

**Q: "Give an example of how you improved an existing vulnerability management process."**

*Structure your response:*
- Current state analysis and pain points identification
- Solution design and stakeholder engagement
- Implementation approach and change management
- Measurable outcomes and ROI calculation

**Q: "Tell me about a time you had to handle multiple critical vulnerabilities simultaneously."**

*Demonstrate:*
- Systematic prioritization methodology
- Resource allocation and team coordination
- Communication strategies across stakeholders
- Project management and execution skills
- Results achieved and lessons learned

### Communication & Collaboration

**Q: "Describe a time you had to present technical findings to non-technical leadership."**

*Communication skills showcase:*
- Audience analysis and message customization
- Visual presentation and storytelling techniques
- Risk translation into business language
- Clear call-to-action and decision facilitation
- Follow-up and engagement strategies
